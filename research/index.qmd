My mission is to support sustainable and equitable marine ecosystem management through advanced spatial ecology and prediction science. I develop and apply cutting-edge quantitative approaches to understand and predict spatial relationships in marine ecosystems across temporal scales. My research provides insights into how species distributions and predator-prey dynamics respond to environmental changes. I am particularly interested in how spatial and temporal scales impact our capacity to understand and predict ecological patterns. Throughout my work, I strive to generate actionable knowledge that stakeholders can immediately apply to marine spatial planning, sustainable resource management, and climate adaptation efforts.

To accomplish this mission, I work across four research themes:

1.  **Climate biogeography**: Mapping the redistribution of species and ecological communities under potential climate conditions to support adaptation planning efforts.  
2.  **Ecological forecasting**: Validating existing frameworks and developing novel approaches to generate near-term predictions that inform management and conservation decisions at seasonal to decadal time scales.  
3.  **Predator-prey dynamics**: Applying and enhancing joint species distribution models to understand how species-specific responses to ecosystem changes alter spatial and temporal relationships among predators and prey.
4. **Marine spatial planning and resource management**: Incorporating model products into marine spatial planning, offshore wind energy development, and fisheries management to enhance resilience to future climate changes.
