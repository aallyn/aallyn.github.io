## Overview
Testing more and again. I am interested in developing and applying quantitative methods to understand the relationships between ecological processes and patterns and then predict how these relationships might play out under future ecosystem conditions. Currently, I pursue this general interest working on a wide range of questions related to species distribution and abundance. Most of this work covers fairly broad spatial scales and long term, climatic time scales. Though, certain projects do strive to provide results at more local spatial scales and over more near-term temporal scales better aligned with the time scales that decision making processes unfold. Along side the distribution and abundance work, I am also hoping to kick start some patch dynamics work. This research would key in on the fine-scale processes that generate and maintain foraging hotspots within marine ecosystems, providing the necessary energy transfer stations to support the growth, survival and productivity of apex predators.

## Species Distribution and Abundance Under Changing Environmental Conditions

### Correlations to Mechanisms
Advancing our mechanistic understanding of species distribution and abundance shifts, with particular focus on the potential role of the environment versus predator-prey biological interactions. 

### Single Species to Biological Communities
Building our understanding of how biological communities and predator-prey interactions may respond to changing environmental conditions

### Academic to Practical
Increasing the connection between species distribution model products and stakeholder information needs

### Applied to Theoretical
Expanding our theoretical knowledge of spatio-temporal models and prediction skill across space and time scales to identify and contribute to targeted model developments.

## Patch Dynamics
Research projects coming soon...
