I am particularly interested in how spatial and temporal scales impact our capacity to understand and predict ecological patterns.

    "section": "Climate Biogeography",
    "text": "Climate Biogeography\n\nOverview\nAs ocean temperatures rise, one of the clearest biological responses has been the redistribution of marine species. Across the globe, species are shifting their ranges — often toward cooler waters or deeper depths — in search of more suitable environmental conditions. These distribution changes can cascade through ecosystems, altering community structure and predator–prey dynamics, changing habitat use, and affecting the availability of key resources. For communities and decision-makers, this creates new challenges around resource access, governance, and equity. Climate biogeography is the field focused on understanding, quantifying, and projecting these shifts. By examining how species distributions respond to environmental change, climate biogeography provides essential insights for long-term planning and adaptation — from conserving biodiversity to managing fisheries and sustaining coastal livelihoods.\nTo anticipate and respond to these changes, we develop and apply advanced spatio-temporal models that characterize species–environment relationships and account for latent spatial and temporal structure (e.g., through tools like sdmTMB and tinyVAST). These statistical models are then coupled with global climate projections to forecast future distributional shifts across scales — from entire large marine ecosystems to specific fisheries and communities. Incorporating spatial patterns of fishing effort allows us to link ecological projections with real-world impacts, supporting more informed and adaptive management in a changing ocean.\n\n\nCurrent Projects\nCrossing Boundaries: Understanding and Projecting Species Distribution Shifts in U.

    "section": "Ecological Forecasting",
    "text": "Ecological Forecasting\n\nOverview\nGlobal climate change is reshaping marine ecosystems, introducing growing uncertainty for the people and communities that depend on them. In rapidly warming regions like the Northeast U.S. Large Marine Ecosystem (NES LME), physical and biological changes are already influencing the growth, survival, and productivity of many ecologically and economically important species. These shifts present complex challenges for marine management, where decisions must increasingly account for dynamic and uncertain futures rather than relying solely on historical baselines.\nEcological forecasting is an emerging field that aims to provide forward-looking information about ecosystem states on timescales relevant to decision-making — from seasons to decades. To meet this need, we develop and refine near-term forecasts by integrating species distribution models, spatio-temporal statistics, and emerging artificial intelligence tools. By linking these models to real-world decision contexts, we aim to deliver actionable forecasts that support resource users, managers, coastal communities, and policymakers. Alongside these applications, our work also contributes to model development and ecological theory. We are particularly focused on understanding and improving predictive skill in distribution models, and on capturing ecological responses that vary across space and time — from basin-wide environmental shifts to local-scale fisheries impacts. In doing so, we help create the space to anticipate change, evaluate trade-offs, and make more informed decisions in an increasingly uncertain ocean.\n\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nCINAR Near-Term Ecological Forecasting Workshop\nNASA Fisheries and Climate Toolkit\n\n\n\nRelevant Publications\n\nGrüss and Allyn et al. In review.

    "text": "Predator-Prey Dynamics\n\nOverview\nUnderstanding ecosystem change requires moving beyond single-species perspectives to capture the interactions that structure marine food webs. Predator–prey dynamics play a central role in shaping species distributions, energy transfer, and ecosystem resilience. By studying how species co-occur and respond to shared environmental drivers, we gain deeper insight into the conditions that support foraging hotspots, productivity, and trophic connectivity in a changing ocean.\nOur work in this area advances from traditional single-species distribution models to joint species distribution models that incorporate inter-species associations and shared habitat use. These approaches offer a more holistic view of community dynamics and allow us to identify spatial patterns of energy flow through the ecosystem. Increasingly, we are also incorporating marine birds into this work, both as top predators in their own right and as sentinels of broader ecosystem change. Their movements and distributions can reveal biologically important areas where prey are aggregated and energy is transferred through the food web. By integrating spatial ecology, predator–prey modeling, and ecosystem indicators, we aim to build a more complete picture of marine ecosystem function, which can inform ecosystem-based management and identify ecologically significant areas under pressure from climate and human use.\n\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nNSF Nutrional Ecology of Climate Change\nNational SeaGrant American Lobster Research Program: Improving lobster distribution models\nNSF Research Experience for Undergrads: Casco Bay Marine Bird Monitoring Pilot Study\n\n\n\nRelevant Publications\n\nAllyn et al. In prep.

    "text": "Marine Spatial Planning and Resource Management\n\nOverview\nAs marine ecosystems change and ocean uses diversify, there is a growing need for science that can inform balanced, forward-looking decisions about how we manage space and resources. From offshore energy development to habitat conservation and sustainable fisheries, marine spatial planning requires clear, spatially explicit information about where species are likely to be — and how those patterns may shift over time.\nOur work brings species distribution models into these applied decision contexts. By integrating our ecological predictions with human-use data, we support planning efforts that seek to reduce conflicts among competing uses, improve spatial efficiency, and protect ecologically important areas. In fisheries management, these tools help anticipate shifts in stock availability, identify potential changes in overlap between target species and fleet activity, and inform adaptive strategies under climate change. By aligning ecological modeling with the scales and priorities of resource governance, we aim to provide actionable science that supports more equitable, effective, and resilient ocean management.\n\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nMid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council Contract: Evaluating indicators and developing a framework to support fisheries governance of shifting stocks.\nGMRI Climate Fisheries Resource Hub\n\n\n\nRelevant Publications\n\nFarchadi et al. 2024.

    "text": "About me\n\nMy name is Andrew Allyn and I am a quantitative spatial ecologist working at the intersection of ecological theory and applied science. I strive to develop and apply cutting-edge approaches to understand and predict spatial relationships in marine ecosystems across temporal scales. Currently, I work as a senior research manager in Dr. Kathy Mills’ Integrated Systems Ecology Lab at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine. During my time at GMRI, I completed my PhD in Marine Science and Technology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I also did my master’s research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation. My master’s work included an extensive field work component studying the elusive Kittlitz’s murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) in Prince William Sound, Alaska. It was the habitat use patterns of that small seabird that ignited my interest in understanding and predicting the spatial dynamics of ecological phenomena.\n\n\nI continually benefit from the generosity of others providing their code and I am committed to contributing open, reproducible and collaborative science. To that end, I provide all of my research code on GitHub. I am always interested in helping others adapt my code for their purposes, or chatting more generally about climate biogeography, ecological forecasting, predator-prey dynamics, or marine spatial planning and resource management. I am also happy to discuss my work with more general audiences, especially college, high school or middle school students from under represented groups that have had limited exposure to the marine sciences world."
